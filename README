# Custom Start App

## Description
  Creates a custom App with git Tracking and Added README, License file.

## How to use it
- Git clone the app into your app directory since this is a separate app in itself.
- Add this app inside projects `settings.py` file inside `Installed Apps`:
  ```INSTALLED_APPS = [
    .......,

    'coreutils',

    .........
  ]```
  And you are good to go

- Now instead of using *startapp* in `python manage.py startapp app_name` use *start-app* like `python manage.py **start-app** app_name`.

** Now your new app with all new files will be created.**.
